# RAG Optimization Strategy Request

## Current System State

We currently have a single Supabase table called `academic_chunks` with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE academic_chunks (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    embedding VECTOR(1536),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

Our current chunking strategy for the Finance program requirements uses GPT-4 for intelligent chunking rather than regex-based approaches. The chunking process:
1. Sends the raw content to GPT-4
2. Asks it to break the content into natural, contextual chunks
3. Each chunk includes a clear title and complete sentences
4. Preserves exact course codes, credit numbers, and requirements
5. Keeps related information together (e.g., all junior year requirements in one chunk)
6. Includes metadata about the type of content, year level, etc.

## Upcoming Context Additions

We're planning to add several new types of content to our RAG system. Here's what's coming and why each is necessary:

1. **Gen Ed Course Requirements**
   - Purpose: Students need to understand which Gen Ed courses fulfill which requirements
   - Contains: Course codes, names, descriptions, and categories
   - Critical for: Helping students plan their Gen Ed requirements strategically

2. **Full Academic Catalog**
   - Purpose: Comprehensive course information for all available courses
   - Contains: Detailed course descriptions, prerequisites, credit hours
   - Critical for: Providing detailed course information and prerequisite chains

3. **Student Transcripts**
   - Purpose: Track completed courses and progress
   - Contains: Courses taken, grades, credits earned
   - Critical for: Personalized advice based on completed coursework

4. **Course Schedules**
   - Purpose: Enable course registration recommendations
   - Contains: Course offerings, times, professors, seats available
   - Critical for: Helping students plan upcoming semesters and register for courses

5. **Student Profile Data**
   - Purpose: Personalize recommendations
   - Contains: Interests, goals, learning preferences, career objectives
   - Critical for: Tailoring advice to individual student needs and preferences

## Questions for Strategy Development

1. **Database Structure**
   - Should we maintain a single table or create specialized tables?
   - If multiple tables, how should they be structured for optimal RAG performance?
   - How should we handle relationships between different types of content?

2. **Chunking Strategy**
   - Should we continue using GPT-4 for intelligent chunking across all content types?
   - Are there certain content types that would benefit from different chunking approaches?
   - How can we ensure chunks maintain context while staying focused enough for accurate RAG?

3. **Embedding Strategy**
   - Should different types of content use different embedding approaches?
   - How can we optimize embedding storage and retrieval for different query types?
   - Should we implement different similarity thresholds for different content types?

4. **Query Optimization**
   - How should we prioritize or combine different types of content in responses?
   - Should we implement different search strategies for different types of queries?
   - How can we ensure the most relevant content is retrieved regardless of type?

5. **Personalization Strategy**
   - How should we structure student profile data to influence RAG results?
   - Should we implement weighted relevance based on student preferences?
   - How can we ensure personalization without losing general accuracy?

## Request

Please provide a comprehensive strategy for:
1. Optimal database structure to handle all these content types
2. Recommended chunking approaches for each content type
3. Embedding and retrieval optimization strategies
4. Query handling and content combination approaches
5. Personalization implementation recommendations

The goal is to create a system that can efficiently and accurately answer student questions like:
- "What Gen Ed courses could I take next semester that align with my interest in psychology?"
- "Based on my transcript, what finance electives am I eligible to take?"
- "Given my career goals in investment banking, what course path do you recommend?"
- "Can you help me build a schedule for next semester that works with my preference for afternoon classes?"

Please provide specific recommendations for implementation, including any suggested table structures, chunking strategies, and query optimization approaches.
